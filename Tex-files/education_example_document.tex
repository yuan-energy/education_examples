\section{Chapter Summary and Highlights}

In the Chapter, the mechanical behaviors of elastoplastic materials
is tested. The purpose is to simulate the simplest material points
or the simplest solid brick for the sake of education. 

Section.\ref{section_elastic_constitutive_example} and 
Section.\ref{section_elastoplastic_constitutive_example} are testing
one material point directly. 

Section.\ref{section_elastic_brick_example} and 
Section.\ref{section_elastoplastic_brick_example} are testing the 
material (Gauss Points) through the 8-node solid brick element. 

Distinct yield surfaces are tested, including von-Mises and 
Drucker-Prager yield surfaces with associative and 
non-associative plastic flow. 

Likewise, various hardening rules are simulated, including 
isotropic hardening, kinematic hardening, 
Armstrong-Frederick hardening, and multi-yield-surface hardening.
