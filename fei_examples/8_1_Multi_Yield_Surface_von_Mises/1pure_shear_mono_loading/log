Static startup tips:                                           
 * Remember: Every command ends with a semicolon ';'.          
 * Type 'quit;' or 'exit;' to finish.                          
 * Run 'essi -h' to see available command line options.

***  Constitutive Testing ***
Test condition: Pure Shear with Strain Control
confine_strain    = 0.001000 
strain_incr    = 0.000010 
max_strain     = 0.015000 
number_of_incr = 1500.000000 
Stress and Strain State before Constitutive Testing
stress = 
[      0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 
       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 
       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000] 
strain = 
[      0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 
       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 
       0.00000000 	       0.00000000 	       0.00000000] 
***  Constitutive Testing Done!  *** 
Strain and stress are output to strain.feioutput and stress.feioutput, respectively.
How polite! Bye, have a nice day!
